# PHP plugin

This plugin includes basic [value types](./index.ts) for PHP plus templates for producing PHP code. The templates are:

1. [Poco](./Poco.handlebars) - Template for a class that holds the properties of a model class

# TODO:

An ANTLR grammar is present with the intent of turning it into a parser for harvesting from PHP source code.
